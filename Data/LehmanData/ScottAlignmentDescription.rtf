Scott aligned sequences SRA\
Each sequence was individually aligned to the reference by the following protocol.\'a0 First, a sequence was mapped to the reference sequence with BWASW and unaligned 5\'92 and 3\'92 ends trimmed off.\'a0 The remaining sequence was then aligned to the reference sequence using Clustalw2.\'a0 Alignment gaps generally were short frameshift-inducing deletions in the clinical sequence and were overrepresented in low-complexity sequences (in particular poly-N runs), suggesting sequencing error rather than mutation.\'a0 Codons with a gap were masked with N\'92s, as were the upstream and downstream codon.}
