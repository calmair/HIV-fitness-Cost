Ey,

I finally found one way to download the data from the PrepStudy.
You have to go to this site: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/home/download.shtml
and click on the FTP download button, then you log on as guest and you have to click through several folders
sra/sra-instant/reads/ByStudy/sra/SRP/SRP049/SRP049715

I just copied the files to my computer. Didn't take to long.

I want to try to figure out how to use the Aspera tool as well, but at least this is one way to do it.

Have a nice evening!

Marion
